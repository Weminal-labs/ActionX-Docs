# ActionX Introduction

Developed by **Oraichain Labs, EUENO ( / 'iu en nə /) **enables **Web3** projects to **build large-scale dApps, providing end-to-end encryption, big data storage, dynamic access control**, and **easy sharing**.

- **Decentralized Storage & Sharing for Big Data: EUENO** provides a large storage capacity beyond that of blockchain. Still decentralized – totally – and sharing instantly through a scalable network of data shared between P2P nodes. Each user (permission-ed or permissionless) shares a portion of his storage capacity to complement the decentralization of the network storage and data recovery by design.

- **Chain-agnostic Operation**: The disadvantage of limited storage on the blockchain leads to EUENO’s solution to change the way of storing and broadcasting data to different blockchains. EUENO is chain-agnostic and complements every blockchain in data storage capacity for DApps development. Store at Eueno and stream to all chains with end-to-end data encryption. 

- **Achieving Privacy, Security & Transparency**: EUENO encrypts data by default and deploys strong security in each process related to any data. Encryption and decryption are completely on the user side, directly through non-custodial wallet services like [Wallet](https://www.example.com)
, with a combination of AES-GCM symmetric encryption technology and asymmetric Elliptic curve cryptography to ensure security and improve encryption performance. 

- **Serverless solution for Web3**: Eueno is built based on web-torrent protocol and practically optimized for users to become a hosting node (client browser, computer node) and increase bandwidth when downloading data. Hosting data is done on the client side of each dApp. This ensures the security and ownership of data.
